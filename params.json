{"name":"Stackfoward Api","tagline":"StackFoward api","body":"###Stackfoward is a library of popular server applications and development environments that can be installed with one click, either in your laptop, in a virtual machine or hosted in the cloud. We take care of compiling and configuring the applications and all of their dependencies (third-party libraries, language runtimes, databases) so they work out-of-the-box. The resulting packaged software (a 'stack') is then made available as native installers, virtual machines and cloud images. These Stackfoward application packages provide a consistent, secure and optimized end-user experience when deploying any app, on any platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nStackfoward API v2.0\r\nWhy Beta?\r\n\r\nWe wanted to release the v2 API to the Stackfoward community in a mostly-final form and provide the opportunity for developers and partners to provide feedback and comments. We know that once an API is launched in a final form, any fundamental changes wreak havoc on developers and the applications they've built.\r\n\r\nWe want to hear what you think. We're open for comments from May 3rd through May 17th, 2014. Email your feedback to api@Stackfoward.com. Once we've had an opportunity to hear from the community, we'll incorporate the appropriate changes and lock down a final version of the API on May 26th, 2014.\r\n\r\nWe're really excited about the rich dataset behind Stackfoward 2.0 and the opportunities it presents to developers. We're looking forward to working with our developer community and seeing the fantastic applications and analysis that you can do!\r\n\r\nKurt Freytag\r\nHead of Product & Engineering\r\nStackfoward\r\n\r\nAccessing the Stackfoward Dataset\r\n\r\nWe provide the Stackfoward Dataset under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License [CC-BY-NC] as described in our Terms of Service and Licensing Guidelines.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to incorporate all or part of the Stackfoward Dataset into your application. To protect the communityâ€™s investment in the Stackfoward Dataset and to safeguard its integrity, we require a separate license for commercial uses regardless of how you access the Dataset. Members of the Stackfoward Venture Program do not require a new license.\r\nGetting Started\r\n\r\nThe Stackfoward API provides a read-only interface to the Stackfoward Dataset. Documentation and examples can be found on this website and access to the API is granted immediately following registration. We limit usage to 2,500 calls per day. To increase your rate limit, just email us at api@Stackfoward.com. Technical questions and suggestions should be sent to api@Stackfoward.com.\r\nAccess to Stackfoward API v1\r\n\r\nStackfoward will provide access to the v1 API until August 1, 2014. Please note that data returned by the  API ceased updating on April 21st, 2014. Documentation for the  API can be found on developer.Stackfoward.com.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
