We take care of compiling and configuring the applications and all of their dependencies (third-party libraries, language runtimes, databases) so they work out-of-the-box. The resulting packaged software (a 'stack') is then made available as native installers, virtual machines and cloud images. These Stackfoward application packages provide a consistent, secure and optimized end-user experience when deploying any app, on any platform.</h3>

<p>Stackfoward API v2.0
Why Beta?</p>

<p>We wanted to release the v2 API to the Stackfoward community in a mostly-final form and provide the opportunity for developers and partners to provide feedback and comments. We know that once an API is launched in a final form, any fundamental changes wreak havoc on developers and the applications they've built.</p>

<p>We want to hear what you think. We're open for comments from May 3rd through May 17th, 2014. Email your feedback to <a href="mailto:api@Stackfoward.com">api@Stackfoward.com</a>. Once we've had an opportunity to hear from the community, we'll incorporate the appropriate changes and lock down a final version of the API on May 26th, 2014.</p>

<p>We're really excited about the rich dataset behind Stackfoward 2.0 and the opportunities it presents to developers. We're looking forward to working with our developer community and seeing the fantastic applications and analysis that you can do!</p>
